# What is it?
It is a maximally simple extension for Chrome browser which auto-saves current session (windows, tabs) and allows to restore them in case of a browser crash/power failure/accidental close/etc.
# What is does?
The only function of the extension is to save your tabs to your disk and let you open them again. You can see the code here – there's nothing more, no ads, no spam, no data collecting, no XHRs…
PRIORITY is on reliable saving, reliable restoring and low resources (RAM, CPU).
# Why would you do this for free?
I'm not a software developer. I'm a hobby coder. I made it for me and my wife. Why not publish it?
