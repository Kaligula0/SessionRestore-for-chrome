# 1) What is it?
It is an extension for Chrome browser. It is designed to be maximally simple.
# 2) What is does?
It auto-saves current session (windows, tabs) and allows to restore them in case of a browser crash/power failure/accidental close/etc.
The only function of the extension is to save your tabs to your disk and let you open them again. You can see the code here – there's nothing more, no ads, no spam, no data collecting, no XHRs…
PRIORITY is on reliable saving, reliable restoring and low resources (RAM, CPU).
# 3) Why would you do this?
I know Chrome can restore tabs. But didn't it happen to you that once Chrome couldn't make it? To me – multiple times.
# 4) Why for free? Where is the catch?
I'm not a software developer. I'm a hobby coder. I made it for me and my wife. Why not publish it?
# 5) Details
• Auto-saving every 5 minutes by default. (Maybe this will become a user setting if you need.)
• You can restore any singular tab, many tabs or whole window, even multiple windows – everything that was open.
• We have 5 MB to use for this purpose ;) As it saves every 5 minutes I decided to use 20% (maybe this will become a user setting if you need), and for me this makes about 30 of last saved sessions with 25-30 tabs each.
• If you want you can permit it in Incognito mode – it can also restore Incognito window as Incognito again.
